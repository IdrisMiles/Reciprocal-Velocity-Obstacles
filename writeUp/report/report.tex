\section{Introduction}
This is the introduction, I will talk about crowd simulations and their usage in games, animation & VFX.
\newpage

\section{Local Avoidance in Crowd Simulation}
what is local avoidance, how does it differ from global nav and AI.
Various methods, Boids, Social Forces, RVO. analyse them and how good/useful they are
\\
\section{RVO}
RVO  is a method of collision avoidance, it is agent based and can be used in crowd  simulation.
It orignates from robots (cite).
\subsection{How RVO Works}
It works by magic...
\subsection{RVO Implementation}
pseudo code of some form can probably go here.
\newpage

\section{Optimizations}
Changing the VO so not so conservative in dense areas.\\
Moving heavy computation to a compute shader.\\
\section{Conclusion}
My conclusion and evaluation.\\
\newpage

\section{Bibliography/Citations}
referencing and stuff. \\
